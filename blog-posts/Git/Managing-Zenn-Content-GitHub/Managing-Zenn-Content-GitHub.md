## Zenn CLI Installation and Project Creation
1. Installing Zenn CLI
Zenn CLI allows you to write and preview articles or books in your local environment. First, we will use npm (Node.js package manager) to install Zenn CLI.
    ```bash
    npm install zenn-cli --global
    ```
2. Creating a New Zenn Article
    ```bash
    zenn new:article
    ```

   1. Access the GitHub website and sign in.
   2. Click the '+' icon on the top right of the homepage and select 'New repository'.
   3. Input the repository name (e.g., zenn-contents). While the name is up to you, zenn-contents is recommended.
2. Push the Zenn Project to the GitHub Repository
   1. Clone the new GitHub repository using the following command:
