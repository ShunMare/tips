Performing system operations is a crucial part of managing a Linux system. Here are some essential commands for handling 

## System Operations in Linux
### `ps`: Display currently active processes

- Basic usage:
  ```bash
  $ ps
  ```

- Show all processes for all users:
  ```bash
  $ ps aux
  ```

### `top`: Real-time Process Monitoring
- Basic usage:
  ```bash
  $ top
  ```

- Some key commands while `top` is running:
  - `q`: Quit top
  - `u`: Show processes for a specific user
  - `k`: Kill a specific process

### `kill`: Terminate Processes
- Basic usage (using process ID):
  ```bash
  $ kill [process_id]
  ```

- Send a specific signal to a process (e.g., sending the SIGKILL signal):
  ```bash
  $ kill -[signal] [process_id]
  ```
  For example, to send the `SIGKILL` signal:
    ```bash
    $ kill -9 [process_id]
    ```

### `shutdown`: Shutdown or restart the system
- Shutdown immediately:
  ```bash
  $ shutdown -h now
  ```

- Reboot immediately:
  ```bash
  $ shutdown -r now
  ```

- Shutdown with a message:
  ```bash
  $ shutdown -h +10 "System will shutdown in 10 minutes"
  ```

This will shut down the system in 10 minutes and broadcast the provided message to all logged-in users.

Understanding these system operation commands is essential for effectively managing and maintaining a Linux system.
