To monitor and troubleshoot Elasticsearch, you can use various `curl` commands to retrieve information about the cluster's status, settings, and potential issues. Here's a summary of some essential commands:

## Node Information:
```bash
curl -X GET "elasticsearch:9200/_nodes?pretty"
```
Retrieve detailed information about all nodes in the cluster.

## Index Listing:
```bash
curl -X GET "elasticsearch:9200/_cat/indices?v"
```
Display a list of all indexes in the cluster.

## Cluster Settings:
```bash
curl -X GET "elasticsearch:9200/_cluster/settings?pretty"
```
View the cluster's configuration settings.

## Task Information:
```bash
curl -X GET "elasticsearch:9200/_cat/tasks?v"
```
Display running cluster tasks.

## Allocation Information:
```bash
curl -X GET "elasticsearch:9200/_cat/allocation?v"
```
Show shard allocation information for each node.

## Elasticsearch Logs:
You can directly check Elasticsearch logs to obtain error messages, warnings, and other crucial information. If Elasticsearch is running in a Docker container, you can view the container's logs using the following command:
```bash
docker logs [container_id_or_name]
```

## Elasticsearch Tools:
Elasticsearch provides tools like `elasticsearch-node` and `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` to collect diagnostic information and manage settings. These tools are available within the directory where Elasticsearch binaries are installed.

By using these methods, endpoints, and tools, you can efficiently monitor the state, configuration, and potential issues of your Elasticsearch cluster.

Remember that Elasticsearch's health and status information can be pivotal for maintaining a healthy and performant cluster.
