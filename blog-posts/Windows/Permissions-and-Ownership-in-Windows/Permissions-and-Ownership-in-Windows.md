In Windows, files and directories have a set of permissions that can be assigned to individual users or groups. These permissions include Read, Write, Execute, and many others.

- **Read (R):** Allows reading the file's contents.
- **Write (W):** Permits modifying the file's contents.
- **Execute (X):** Enables executing the file as a program.

## Changing File Permissions with icacls

You can use the `icacls` command to modify access permissions for files and directories.

```bash
C:\> icacls file.txt /grant John:R  # Grant read permission to John
C:\> icacls file.txt /deny John:W   # Deny write permission to John
```

## Changing File Owner with takeown
The `takeown` command lets you change the owner of files and directories.
```bash
C:\> takeown /F file.txt /A  # Change the file's owner to the Administrators group
```

## Viewing File Permissions with icacls
The `icacls` command displays file and directory access permissions, owner, and other details.
```bash
C:\> icacls file.txt
file.txt NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
         BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
         BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)
```

Understanding and managing permissions and ownership is crucial for maintaining security and proper access control in a Windows system.
