Performing system operations is a crucial part of managing a Windows system. Here are some essential commands for handling system operations.

## `tasklist`: Display currently active processes
- Basic usage:
  ```bash
  C:\> tasklist
  ```

## `taskmgr`: Real-time Process Monitoring
- Basic usage:
  ```bash
  C:\> taskmgr
  ```

This will open the Task Manager GUI where you can monitor and manage processes.

## `taskkill`: Terminate Processes
- Basic usage (using process ID):
  ```bash
  C:\> taskkill /PID [process_id]
  ```

- Terminate a process by its name:
  ```bash
  C:\> taskkill /IM [process_name]
  ```

  For example, to kill a process named "notepad.exe":
    ```bash
    C:\> taskkill /IM notepad.exe
    ```

## `shutdown`: Shutdown or restart the system
- Shutdown immediately:
  ```bash
  C:\> shutdown /s /t 0
  ```

- Reboot immediately:
  ```bash
  C:\> shutdown /r /t 0
  ```

- Shutdown with a message:
  ```bash
  C:\> shutdown /s /t 600 /c "System will shutdown in 10 minutes"
  ```

  This will shut down the system in 10 minutes and display the provided message.

Understanding these system operation commands is essential for effectively managing and maintaining a Windows system.
