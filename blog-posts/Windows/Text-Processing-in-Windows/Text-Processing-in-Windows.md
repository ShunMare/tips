## Searching within Text
- `findstr`: Search for strings in files.
  - `/I`: Ignore case.
  - `/S`: Searches for matching files in the current directory and all subdirectories.
  - `/V`: Print only lines that do not contain a match.
    ```bash
    C:\> findstr "search_term" file.txt
    This line contains the search_term.
    ```
    ```bash
    C:\> findstr /I "Search_Term" file.txt
    This line contains the search_term.
    ```

## Filtering and Transforming Text
- There's no direct equivalent to `awk` in Windows, but you can use PowerShell or other scripting languages for similar tasks.

- `powershell -Command "(Get-Content file.txt) -replace 'World', 'Universe'"`: Use PowerShell to replace text.
  ```bash
  C:\> echo Hello World | powershell -Command "$input -replace 'World', 'Universe'"
  Hello Universe
  ```

## Sorting and Counting
- `sort`: Sort input.
  ```bash
  C:\> echo banana & echo apple & echo cherry | sort
  apple
  banana
  cherry
  ```
- There's no direct `uniq` equivalent in Windows, but you can use PowerShell for similar tasks.
- `find /c /v ""`: Count lines in a file.
  ```bash
  C:\> echo Hello World | find /c /v ""
  1
  ```

## Text Display
- `type`: Display the content of files.
  ```bash
  C:\> type file.txt
  This is the content of file.txt.
  ```
- There's no direct `tac` equivalent in Windows, but you can use PowerShell for similar tasks.
- `more +n`: Display content starting from the nth line. (Similar to `tail`)
  ```bash
  C:\> echo line1 & echo line2 & echo line3 | more +1
  line2
  line3
  ```
